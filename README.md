Watch your cat while you're away. 

Big WIP at the moment :P

### Planned additions
- Web interface
- Means of interaction with pet (speakers)
- Food-dispensing capabilities

### Hardware
Haven't yet gotten to this phase in development, but here's a general breakdown:
- Raspberry Pi Zero
- PIR motion detector
- Pi Zero compatible PiCamera (probably going to be a ripoff from aliexpress)
- 1 or 2 servo motors for food dispenser portion
- (Ideally) 3D-printed housing
